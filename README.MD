# Greydwarfs Don't Circle

This makes a small change to the behavior of Greydwarfs, Greylings, Greydwarf Brutes, and Greydwarf Shammans. 

# Features
Removes circling behavior from Greydwarfs, Greylings, Greydwarf Brutes, and Greydwarf Shammans

# Explanation
During combat, enemies will sometimes run around the player. The game seems to refer to this behavior as 'circling'. The enemy does this for a few seconds and at a certain distance from the player. 
As I fought more Greydwarfs, Greylings, etc... I noticed this behavior would result in my chacing them around in an attempt to kill them. I would initiate a fight, they would attack me, and then they would run away for a short period (completing their 'circling' behavior.
I created this mod to make Greydwarfs (Etc..) less of an annoyance to fight. Do note, I assume this mod will cause these monsters to surround you more often since they will always be approaching you. Some may find this more challenging.
